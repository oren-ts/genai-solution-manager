### Exercise Statement

**ID:** 02.Ü.03  
**Task:**

> Create one open and one closed prompt on the following topic:
> **Topic:** Sustainable urban development  
> Make sure that the open prompt allows for creative or varied responses, while the closed prompt elicits a precise and structured response.  
> **Addendum:** Explain in 2–3 sentences the difference between your two prompts and why the closed prompt leads to a more specific answer.

### Tutor Guidance

That is a perfect topic for demonstrating the **"Probability Control"** we've been practicing. **Sustainable urban development** is a massive domain, making it easy to see how a lack of framework leads to **open** variability versus how a **narrow framework** (Section 2.2) creates **closed** precision.

Following our established process:

- Analyze the requirements first
- Then the learner creates the two prompts
- Finally, both prompts are reviewed and compared

#### Strategy for Exercise 02.Ü.03

- **Open Prompt Goal:** Trigger the AI's *creative/generative* mode. According to Section 2.2, this should provide *room for interpretation* and *variable results*.
- **Closed Prompt Goal:** Trigger the AI's *structured/factual* mode. This requires a **Narrow Framework** (Section 2.2) and **Explicit Restrictions** (Section 2.4).

### Learner Task – Open Prompt

> **Instruction:**  
> Create the **Open Prompt** first.  
> **Topic:** Sustainable urban development.  
> **Requirement:** Keep it broad enough that five different AI models would likely give you five completely different styles of answers (e.g., poem, technical list, philosophical essay).

#### Learner’s Open Prompt

> **Open Prompt:**  
> *"Come up with creative ideas about sustainable urban development"*

#### Tutor Feedback on Open Prompt

- This is a **textbook example** of an open prompt.
- It perfectly captures the spirit of **Section 2.2**.

**Senior Critique: The Open Prompt**

- **Room for Interpretation:** ✅ High – responses could range from *solar-powered benches* to *de-growth manifestos*.
- **Lack of Framework:** ✅ No limits on number of ideas, geographic focus or feasibility.
- **Variable Results:** ✅ Ten runs would likely yield ten different structures (lists, essays, bullet points, etc.).

### Learner Task – Closed Prompt

The learner must now create a **Closed Prompt** on the same topic:

> **Topic:** Sustainable urban development  
> **Goal:** Turn this into a closed prompt with a narrow framework and explicit restrictions.

**Constraints for a Closed Prompt (from course):**

- Set a **Narrow Framework** (e.g., exact number of items)
- Assign a **Role** (professional perspective)
- Define a **Structure** (format, sections, tables)
- Add **Explicit Restrictions** (word count, scope limits)

#### Learner’s Closed Prompt

> *"I'm a newly elected city parliament member in Berlin, Germany. I'm about to join a task force that its goal is to solve the increasing rental prices in Berlin by meeting the increasing demand for affordable housing. Create a report of 2000 words, analyzing sustainable urban development from 5 major cities in the world with population greater than 4 million inhabitants. The report includes the following for each city: 1. the problem 2. the approaches for the sustainable development 3. the investment 4. the results"*

The learner then asks:

> *"evaluate my prompt"*

#### Tutor Critique: Analysis of the Closed Prompt

**The Wins (Pillars of Chapter 2)**

- **Context (Section 2.3):** ✅
  - Role: *Berlin Parliament Member*
  - Situation: *Housing task force*
  - Gives the AI a **semantic orientation** (policy-oriented, professional tone).

- **Clarity (Section 2.1):** ✅
  - Problem: *Berlin rental prices / affordable housing*
  - Scope: *5 cities*, each with population *> 4 million*.

- **Structure (Section 2.1):** ✅
  - Required logical sequence per city:  
    *Problem → Approaches → Investment → Results*
  - Avoids "wall of text" and improves scanability.

- **Expectation (Section 2.1):** ✅
  - Word count: *2,000 words* → enforces depth and detail.

**The Risks (Potential Pitfalls)**

- **Hallucination Trap (Section 2.5):** ❌
  - Asking for *investment* and *results* with data may cause the AI to invent specific numbers if "real-world, cited case studies" are not required.

- **Ambiguity Pitfall:** ❌
  - "Sustainable urban development" can mean many things (bike lanes, solar, waste management) while the goal is specifically **affordable housing**.
  - The focus should be tightened so the AI doesn’t drift into unrelated aspects.

- **Format Pitfall:** ❌
  - For ~2,000 words, a flat list can become repetitive.
  - Better to specify **Markdown headers** and possibly tables.

### Suggested "Master" Refinement by Tutor

To upgrade the learner’s prompt from **Good** to **Near-Perfect**, the tutor suggests adding **Explicit Restrictions** and more precise scoping:

> **Role:** Act as a Senior Urban Policy Analyst.  
> **Task:** Create a 2,000-word comparative report for a Berlin Parliamentary Task Force on solving the affordable housing crisis.  
> **Scope:** Select 5 global megacities (e.g., London, New York, Singapore, Vienna, or São Paulo) with populations over 4 million that have implemented successful sustainable housing policies.  
> **Specific Focus:** Only include sustainable developments that directly address **social equity and housing affordability**.  
> **Format:** Use Markdown headers for each city. For each city, provide a table summarizing the **Investment** (in Euro/local currency) and **Key Results** (e.g., units built, % rent reduction) based on **2024/2025 real-world data**.  
> **Structure per City:**  
> 1. The Problem (Context of their housing crisis)  
> 2. The Sustainable Policy Approach  
> 3. Investment Breakdown  
> 4. Measured Results and Lessons for Berlin.

#### Comparison Table for Documentation

| Prompt Type            | Why?                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open Prompt            | "Tell me about sustainable cities." → Too broad, no framework, infinite interpretations.                                                  |
| Learner Closed Prompt  | Provides a specific role, fixed number of cities (5), and a clear structure (problem, approach, investment, results).                       |
| Master Closed Prompt   | Adds real-world data anchoring (2024/2025), narrows topic to housing affordability, and enforces professional formatting (Markdown, tables). |

### Final Addendum – Difference Between Open and Closed Prompt

Learner’s task:

> *"before that, Explain in 2-3 sentences the difference between your two prompts and why the closed prompt leads to a more specific answer."*

#### Tutor’s Explanation

> *"The difference lies in the Narrow Framework (Section 2.2): the open prompt provides a broad topic without constraints, inviting the AI to explore various creative interpretations, whereas the closed prompt establishes a specific Role, Structure, and Explicit Restrictions (Section 2.4). This closed architecture leads to a more specific answer because it significantly limits the 'probability space' of the AI's response, forcing it to follow a strict logical chain and professional format instead of making random statistical guesses."*
