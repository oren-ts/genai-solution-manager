Today started with a gray sky, and I felt sad as I looked out the window. The rain reminded me of last week when everything seemed to go wrong. I tried to cheer up by making coffee, but even that tasted sad today. My friend called, and though it was nice to hear her voice, I couldn’t shake the sad feeling lingering inside. Work was tough too, deadlines piling up, and I felt sad about not keeping up.

Later, I took a walk to clear my mind. The park was quiet, which made me feel sad yet peaceful at the same time. I sat by the lake, watching the ducks, but the solitude brought back that sad memory of losing my favorite book. By evening, I was exhausted, and the sad mood followed me home. I hope tomorrow brings some light, I’m tired of feeling this sad all the time. Maybe I’ll call my sister; she always knows how to lift my spirits when I’m sad.
